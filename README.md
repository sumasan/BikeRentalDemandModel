# Project Name
> Bike Rental Demand Multiple Regression model
 
Aim:
Building Multiple Linear Regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.
  
-To identify variable s affecting bike sharing

-To build linear model which can relate no of bike sharing with other variables like temperature , year, weather etc

-To know the accuracy of the model

-To evaluate the model

## General Information

- What is the background of your project?
  This Upgrad study project, to apply MLR model building concept learnt.This programming assignment is done

- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?
  predicting the dependent factors to increase shared bikes count

- What is the dataset that is being used?
  Shared bikes usage data for 2 years

 
## Conclusions
Shared bikes usage is heavily depends on the feeling temperature and also usage is increasing year on year, 
In a weather situation like rain, thunderstorm and high windspeed less bikes are used
  

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.0
- IDE: Jupiterlab 1.1.4
- Anaconda Navigator 1.9.7
